# Ensou

Ensou is a project aiming to become a broswer version of Synthesia. Current features include visualizing MIDI files, playing MIDI files with samples/ synths, customizing synths, adding effectors to audio, and other common music software functionalities such as looping, ranged loops, metronomes, tempo control. Not only Ensou supports playing with keyboards, MIDI keyboard is also supported.

## Notes
- Currently MIDI files downloaded from the server is downloaded straight from Google Cloud. If this ever becomes a problem, cache with CDNs.
